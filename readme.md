## Auction Project
> Developed by Paras Aggarwal

This project is built to support auctions where: 
- A seller can register a product for auction and specify a minimum bid.
- A buyer can bid on any product (not owned by them) and any number of times.
- A seller can end the auction and see the winner and winning bid.

Notes:
- User information is only stored in Users Service and only a user token is used to represent the user while auctioning and the information for specific user tokens can be fetched from user service if required (thus following GDPR).
- Support to change the minimum bid of a product is not available in this.
- This project doesn't support multiple currencies or currency conversion. Prices are just considered as a price regardless of any currency (think of it as all prices are in Euro).
- User authentication is skipped for now. 
- We are reading the user token from the header but in the real world user token should be fetched from the auth token.

### Services
- Users Service (To store user information)
- Biding Service (To store products and associated bids)

**Basic architecture:**

![basic_architecture.png](docs%2Fbasic_architecture.png)

### Database design
**Users Service**

Table #1: 

`user_record`
- Long id (Primary key)
- String token (unique) -- [UUID format is used]
- String first_name (not nullable)
- String last_name (not nullable)
- String phone_number (unique, not nullable)
- String email (unique, not nullable)
- String street
- String house_number
- String city
- Long pincode
- String country
- String additional_address_info

**Biding Service**

Table #1:

`product_detail`

- Long id (Primary key)
- String name (not nullable)
- String description 
- Double start_price (not nullable)
- Boolean sold (not nullable)
- Double sold_price
- Boolean active
- String city
- String author

Table #2: [foreign key with `product_detail.id`]

`biding_list`

- Long id (Primary key)
- Long product_detail (Foreign key to `product_detail.id`)
- Date timestamp (not nullable, not updatable)
- Double bid_price (not nullable)
- String bider (not nullable, not updatable)

### APIs and curls

**User service**

- `POST: /user {...}`: **To create a new user**
> In response you will receive a `USER_TOKEN` which will be required during biding and product-related actions
```
curl --location 'localhost:8081/user' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName": "vorname",
    "lastName": "nachname",
    "phoneNumber": "+49000000001",
    "email": "qa-bot-1@test.de",
    "street": "straÃŸe",
    "houseNumber": "1",
    "city": "Berlin",
    "pincode": 10178,
    "country": "Germany",
    "additionalAddressInfo": "c/o nachname"
}'
```

- `POST: /user/search {...}`: **To search a user by email or phone number**
```
curl --location 'localhost:8081/user/search' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "qa-bot-1@test.de"
}'
```
or 
```
curl --location 'localhost:8081/user/search' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "phoneNumber": "+49000000001"
}'
```

- `GET: /user/{USER_TOKEN}`: **To get user information based on provided user token.** (`USER_TOKEN` is the same `userToken` field from the create user response - UUID formatted string).
```
curl --location 'localhost:8081/user/{USER_TOKEN}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Biding service**

- `POST: /product {...}`: **To add a new product for auction**. (`USER_TOKEN` is the unique token of the user and can be fetched from `addUser` or `searchUser` response)
> Requires a header `X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}`. This user will be considered an author of the product and should be a valid user as validation will be performed from users service. 
```
curl --location 'localhost:8080/product' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "name": "Mercedes-Benz",
    "description": "Vintage car from 1930",
    "startPrice": 3000,
    "active": true
}'
```

- `GET: /products`: **To get list of products**
> Support a query parameter `allow_inactive`. This supports a boolean value and the default value is true. Added to support inactive products in the products list. e.g. `GET: /products?allow_inactive=false`
```
curl --location 'localhost:8080/products?allow_inactive=false' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

- `PATCH: /product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER} {...}`: **To toggle product status ACTIVE/INACTIVE.** (`PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER` is `id` field of the product and is available in the `addProduct` and `getProducts[]` response).
> Requires a header `X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}` and only the product author can perform this action. The status of the product cannot be changed once it is sold out. This endpoint can also be extended to update product details and minimum bid price.
```
curl --location --request PATCH 'localhost:8080/product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "active": false
}'
```
or 
```
curl --location --request PATCH 'localhost:8080/product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "active": true
}'
```

- `POST: /product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}/bid {...}`: **To place a bid**
> Requires a header `X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}`. This will be considered as a user who is biding and so it should be a valid user. The author of the product cannot perform this action.
```
curl --location 'localhost:8080/product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}/bid' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "price": 4500.00
}'
```

- `POST: /product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}/sold`: **To end the auction for a product**
> Requires a header `X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}`. It should be a valid token and only the author of the product can perform this action (so `USER_TOKEN` should represent the product author). Once auction for a product is ended product will be updated with `sold: true`, `active: false`, `soldPrice: {PRICE}`
```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/product/{PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER}}/sold' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-User-Token: {USER_TOKEN}'
```

### How to install
**Prerequisites:** 
- Java 17
- cURL installed in the terminal or any API platform
- IntelliJ IDEA or any IDE (Developed on IntelliJ so works well with it)
- Enable annotation processing in your IDE (IDE preferences/settings > editor > code style > java > annotation processing)
- Install lombok plugin in your IDE

**Steps**
- Open this project in your IDE (Project should open as a Gradle project)
- Once build and indexing is done
- Open `UsersApplication.java` inside `users/src/main/java/org/deutschebank/auction/users/` and run it.
